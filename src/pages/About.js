                        Why I started all this nonscense:
                        <br></br>
                        I started taking pictures with a point and shoot camera. It was for fun and to contribute to my companies photo contest each month. I happen to win the month that we did a flower theme. Ever since I have not been able to stop. Also, my mom loves when I make a calendar each year of her flowers from her gardens in the spring, summer, and fall.

                    <li>
                        My Cause (the reason behind all the maddness!)
                    <br></br>   
                        I find peace in watching the gardens in the morning. All day for that matter. The birds, squirrels, bees, and butterflies are amazing to watch. I feel that everyone should be able to share in this experience. Sharing is caring!
