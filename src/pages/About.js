                        The Reason behind all this!
                    <br></br>  
                        I want to share with the public what I normally only share with my immediate family and friends. My mom has always said "you should sell this or you should put this or that out there... ", well a millions years later I am following her advice. From a rediculous amouont of years in college; which I ended up becoming undecided in. To spending 17yrs plus at my current company. I have advanced as much as possible and my talents lie elsewhere. My goals have now taken me to a place where I need that job and so much more. 
                        If I can create and make things that others sell for 100's and make if affordable to the normal person; then that's what I want to do. 
                        I can't wait to start this new adventure and see what happens.
